# Probability Simulator

A comprehensive Probability Simulator built in Python for exploring, visualizing, and understanding various probability distributions, random events, and statistical concepts. This tool is designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts to simulate experiments, analyze results, and deepen their grasp of probability theory through interactive code.

## Features

- **Simulate Classic Probability Experiments:**  
  - Coin tosses
  - Dice rolls
  - Card draws
  - Custom events

- **Probability Distributions:**  
  - Uniform, Binomial, Normal, Poisson, and more
  - Generate random samples from distributions
  - Visualize probability mass/density functions

- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  - Calculate mean, variance, and other statistics
  - Run Monte Carlo simulations
  - Compare empirical vs. theoretical results

- **Visualization:**  
  - Plot histograms, PMFs, and CDFs
  - Show convergence of simulated probabilities

- **Extensible:**  
  - Easily add new experiments or distributions
